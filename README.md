## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?

Timely delivery is crucial to meet client expectations, avoid cost overruns, and stay competitive. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting clear goals, monitoring progress, and adjusting resources as needed.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Effective cost control ensures projects stay within budget and maximize resources. To prevent budget overruns, strategies like accurate estimation, regular budget reviews, and risk management are used.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile and Waterfall are two contrasting software development methodologies. Agile is flexible and iterative, focusing on customer satisfaction and continuous delivery. Waterfall is linear and structured, providing a clear path but being less adaptable to changes. While Agile offers flexibility and reduced risk, it can lack structure and be challenging to measure progress. Waterfall provides structure and predictability but can be less adaptable and riskier if changes occur.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is better for projects with evolving requirements, like software development, where flexibility is key. Waterfall suits projects with well-defined requirements, such as construction, where a linear approach is effective.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Quality Assurance Methods include Implementing testing (unit, integration, system), conducting code reviews, and using automated tools to ensure high standards. This prevents defects and maintains software reliability.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Defining the project scope clarifies goals, while a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) decomposes tasks, aiding in organization and management.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

A detailed project schedule helps manage progress. Gantt charts offer a visual timeline for tracking tasks and deadlines.
